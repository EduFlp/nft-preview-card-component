# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge
This was the simplest challenge I've ever completed and the easiest too. It doesn't require JavaScript code, and HTML and CSS commands are well known. The HMTL itself is short and there is no new command. On the other hand, in the CSS part, I learned a new command: z-index. It is controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap.

## Building the project
I started to do the project in a different way compared to the previous ones. I was doing the HTML while developing the CSS. In my opinion, it has become easiear and faster to work this way. Plus, it was a more complete experience because I could see the color and measurement styles automatically forming as I as coding the HTML. In the CSS part, almost the commands were known to me. However, the z-index property was a novelty. I decided to research more to know about the features and it worked perfectly on my website.
